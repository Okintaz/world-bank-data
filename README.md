# 🌍 Energy Import Dependency Analysis

This project analyzes how countries rely on imported energy, and what underlying economic and environmental factors influence that reliance. By combining public World Bank data with clustering and regression techniques, we identify strategic country profiles that reflect global energy patterns.

## 📊 Summary

We examined the following indicators from the World Bank:
- **Energy imports (% of energy use)**
- **GDP per capita (current US$)**
- **Renewable energy consumption (% of final energy use)**
- **Population (total)**

Using this data, we performed:
- 📈 **Regression analysis** to explore linear relationships  
- 🧠 **K-Means clustering** to classify countries into strategic energy profiles  
- 📉 **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** for dimensionality reduction and 2D visualization

## 🔍 Key Clusters Identified

1. **Energy Exporters** – resource-rich, low reliance on imports  
2. **Import-Reliant High-Income** – wealthy nations with exposure risks  
3. **Green Emerging** – rising economies investing in renewables  
4. **Mixed Middle-Income** – diverse group in economic and energy transition
